	"description": "A uniquely-shaped lantern stand, with superbly crafted traditional lanterns hanging from it. This sight is particularly beautiful and can only be seen during the Lantern Rite Festival. After admiring the magnificent scenery, some Liyue residents still follow the tradition of walking through this gate with their families on the last day of the festival holiday, marking the beginning of a new year for the family.",
