	"description": "A fabric storage box often used in Sumeru stores that uses dried Brightwood as base material. It has good desiccating properties, and can effectively prevent the fabric within from being affected by moisture. The interior space can also be used for storage, while items awaiting sale can be mounted up top, thus making this a very convenient multipurpose item.",
